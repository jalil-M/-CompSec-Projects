## HospitalSecureNetwork

In this repository, we created an entire hospital infrastructure with client-server sides on a TLS Network.
In fact, we created types of accounts with a RBAC-style organization, such as :

  * Doctors can create, modify and read its patient records
  * Nurses can read, modify its patients records
  * Government agency can read all the patients records
  * Patients can only read their own records

The key goal of this project was to create a secure hospital infrastructure and organization in order to ensure privacy and secrecy 
to all the hospital's patients without any delay.

Thank you in advance for your time.
